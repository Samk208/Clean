| :---     | :---                                       | :---                                                                                                                                                                  | :---                                                                        |
| **High** | **1. Fix Product Deletion Logic**          | Deleting a product leaves orphaned data, such as images in Supabase Storage and related entries in the `influencer_shop_products` table. This is a data integrity and potential security issue. | `Final Comprehensive Report.md`, `E-commerce Functionality Report.md`         |
| **High** | **2. Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** | The application currently lacks proper role-based access control, creating a significant security risk of unauthorized data access and actions.                               | `Final Comprehensive Report.md`                                             |
| **Medium** | **3. Improve Error Handling**              | The application has inconsistent and uninformative error handling, which negatively impacts user experience and makes debugging difficult.                                    | `E-commerce Functionality Report - Addendum.md`                               |
| **Low**  | **4. Refactor and Optimize Database Schema** | The schema validation checklist identified numerous areas for improvement in the database schema and code quality to enhance long-term maintainability.                         | `Supabase Snippet Supabase Schema Validation Checklist.csv`                   |
