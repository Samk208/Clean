# E-commerce Functionality Report - Addendum

This report provides additional findings not covered in the initial analysis, focusing on specific areas of concern.

### 1. New Finding: Onboarding Data Persistence

- **Issue**: The step-by-step onboarding progress is **not** being saved to the database. The frontend `onboarding/page.tsx` attempts to call API endpoints like `/api/onboarding/step-1`, `/api/onboarding/step-2`, etc., but these endpoints **do not exist**.
- **Current Mechanism**: The application currently relies exclusively on the browser's `localStorage` to save a user's progress. This means if a user clears their cache or switches browsers, their progress will be lost.
- **Impact**: High. This is a significant data integrity risk and prevents the backend from having any visibility into incomplete onboarding sessions.

### 2. New Finding: Source of Supabase Edge Runtime Warnings

- **Source Identified**: The Supabase Edge Runtime warnings are most likely originating from `lib/supabase/middleware.ts`. While the Supabase SSR library is designed for Edge environments, its interaction with the Next.js middleware request/response lifecycle can sometimes indirectly access Node.js APIs, triggering these warnings.
- **Document Uploads Unaffected**: Critically, the document upload API at `/api/onboarding/docs/route.ts` is **not affected** by this issue. It correctly forces the Node.js runtime via `export const runtime = 'nodejs'`, which is the correct approach for routes that handle file processing.

### 3. New Finding: API Endpoint Status

- **/api/onboarding/session**: This endpoint for session tracking **does not exist**. The concept of a backend-managed onboarding session has not been implemented.
- **/api/onboarding/docs**: The backend API for document uploads is **fully functional and robust**. It includes security checks, file sanitization, and proper interaction with Supabase Storage. The failure is purely on the frontend, which uses a simulated upload process instead of calling this API.

### 4. New Finding: Korean Business Validation

- A thorough search of the codebase revealed **no evidence** of any features, components, or API endpoints related to Korean business validation.

## Summary of New Conclusions

1.  **Onboarding Is Frontend-Only**: The onboarding process is almost entirely a frontend-only experience until the final submission. There is no step-by-step data persistence on the backend.
2.  **Backend for Docs is Ready**: The backend for document uploads is complete and waiting for a frontend component to use it.
3.  **Middleware is the Source of Warnings**: The Edge Runtime warnings are isolated to the middleware and do not impact file uploads or other critical backend APIs that have been correctly configured.
